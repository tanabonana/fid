			<p>The BAUD, or Bio Acoustical Utilization Device is a breakthrough device that could help many as long as they have access to it. You simply just plug a headset into the device and listen for 20 minutes as you think about your trauma. The device disrupts the traumatic memories with a specific sound frequency.
			<br>
			<br>
			There is an emotional connection to the memories you have, and when you play a certain frequency it disrupts the link of emotion and memory, so that when your recall the memory the emotional response is no longer connected.
			<br>
			<br>
			Storm Sounds wants to make sure that everyone suffering with PTSD has access to this treatment. This treatment doesn't work for everyone, but for the people that it would work for they may not be able to afford it. Storm Sounds wants to make sure that isn't a problem for you.
