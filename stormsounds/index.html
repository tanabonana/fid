			<p>PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is a condition that effects people who have experienced extreme trauma.
			<br>
			<br>
			Most PTSD sufferers have a hard time sleeping. People who don't suffer from PTSD who have a hard time sleeping will sometimes use storm sounds. Sounds soothing the mind have helped people since humans could hear.
			<br>
			<br>
			Sound therapy has been found to help people with PTSD relieve symptoms such as not being able to sleep. We want to make sure that anyone who needs it has access to this therapy. 
			<br>
			<br>	
			The BAUD, or Bio Acoustical Utilization Device is what is used for this therapy, but it is close to $500 for each device. Our organization "Storm Sounds" wants to make sure that everyone can have access to this device if they need it, regardless of how much money they have.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you or someone you know suffers from PTSD, <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> to learn more.</p>
