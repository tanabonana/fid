	<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
		<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!</p>
	<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
		<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>
	<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
		<p><a href="photopages/countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="view of the rolling tuscan hills" width="100" height="75"></a> This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>
	<h2>Sienna</h2>
		<p><a href="photopages/sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>
	<h2>Cathedral</h2>
		<p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="view of a cathedral" width="75" height="100"></a> This is the cathedral we went to. It was awe inspiring how beautiful and grand it was and you could definitely tell that everyone was feeling the same way. We spent a lot of time just sitting and looking at this cathedral.</p>
	<h2>Lavender</h2>
		<p><a href="lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="view of lavender bush" width="75" height="100"></a> This is the lavender bush we found on our way to the cathedral. It was such a surprise to find this beautiful little bush just randomly growing along the path. We picked a bit for ourselves.</p>
	<h2>Sweets</h2>
		<p><a href="sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the sweets shop" width="100" height="75"></a> This is the sweets shop we found on the way home. We spur of the moment decided to get a little treat for the walk back. We both got a muffin so we could easily walk and eat. </p>
